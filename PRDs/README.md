# 📄 Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) 📘

This folder contains Product Requirement Documents created across **assessments, freelance projects, and professional experience**. These PRDs demonstrate how I translate ambiguous problems into structured requirements, scoped features, and measurable outcomes.

While my formal Product Manager experience is still developing, these documents reflect **hands-on PM thinking**, real constraints, and strong collaboration with engineering and stakeholders.
